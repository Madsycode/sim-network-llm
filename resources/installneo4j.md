Thanks for sharing your config snippet.

Since you're running **Neo4j on Debian inside WSL** and want to **access it from your Windows host system**, you'll need to configure Neo4j to:

1. **Listen on all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`)**
2. **Advertise the correct IP address or hostname**

---

## ‚úÖ Steps to Make Neo4j Accessible from Windows

### üîß 1. Edit the config file `/etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf`

Add or modify these two lines:

```ini
dbms.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0
dbms.default_advertised_address=localhost
```

Or, if using WSL2 and you know the WSL IP address from Windows (get via `wsl hostname -I`), you can set:

```ini
dbms.default_advertised_address=<WSL_IP>
```

> `dbms.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0` tells Neo4j to listen on **all interfaces**, including the one visible to Windows.

> `dbms.default_advertised_address` is what Neo4j tells clients to use in redirects or responses (used for cluster configs or Bolt protocol).

---

### üìç 2. Get WSL IP Address (from Windows)

From PowerShell or CMD:

```bash
wsl hostname -I
```

You‚Äôll get an IP like `172.28.128.1`.

Use this to access Neo4j from Windows:

* **Browser**: [http://172.28.128.1:7474](http://172.28.128.1:7474)
* **Bolt**: bolt://172.28.128.1:7687

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 3. Restart Neo4j

```bash
sudo systemctl restart neo4j
```

Then check it‚Äôs listening:

```bash
ss -tulpn | grep 7474
```

---

### ‚úÖ Access from Browser (on Windows)

Go to:
**http\://\<WSL\_IP>:7474**

> Log in with the default: `neo4j / <password>`
> You‚Äôll be prompted to change the password on first login.

---

## üîê Optional: Allow Windows Firewall Rules (if using custom ports or bridged setup)

WSL typically allows traffic between host and VM by default, but if needed:

```bash
# From PowerShell (run as admin)
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Neo4j WSL" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 7474,7687 -Action Allow
```

---

Let me know if you‚Äôre using **Neo4j Desktop** on Windows and want to connect it to WSL Neo4j, or need password reset.


The **default credentials** for Neo4j are:

* **Username:** `neo4j`
* **Password:** `neo4j` (only on first login)

---

### üîê Important Notes:

* On **first login**, you are **forced to change** the default password.
* If you're connecting via the browser UI (e.g., [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474) or `http://<WSL_IP>:7474`), it will **prompt you to set a new password**.
* After setting a new password, the default `neo4j/neo4j` will no longer work.

---

### ‚ùì Forgot the Password?

You can reset it manually:

#### **Method 1: Using neo4j-admin**

```bash
sudo neo4j-admin set-initial-password newpassword
```

This works **only if** the database has not yet been started and initialized.

#### **Method 2: Manual Reset via Data Deletion**

If the password is set and you can't access it, and you're okay with **losing data**, you can wipe the data store:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop neo4j
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/neo4j/data/databases/*
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/neo4j/data/transactions/*
sudo systemctl start neo4j
```

Then run:

```bash
sudo neo4j-admin set-initial-password yournewpassword
```

Let me know if you need to reset it without wiping data ‚Äî that‚Äôs also possible by editing the auth file.
